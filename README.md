Apple Quality Predictor
A Django web application that uses a Random Forest machine learning model to predict the quality of apples based on their physical characteristics. The app includes user authentication, a prediction interface, and a dashboard to visualize model performance.
Project Overview
This project was developed to predict whether an apple is of "good" or "bad" quality using features like size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. The app features:

User Authentication: Register and log in to access prediction and dashboard features.
Prediction Interface: Input apple characteristics to get a quality prediction.
Dashboard: View model performance metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and quality distribution.

Prerequisites
Python 3.13 (or compatible version)
Git (to clone the repository)
A web browser to access the app

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apple_quality_predictor.git
cd apple_quality_predictor

Install Dependencies:
Using requirements.txt (recommended):pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, manually install the required packages:pip install django pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Add Static Files:
The following files are excluded from the repository due to size and security concerns. You’ll need to obtain or generate them:
predictor/static/apple_quality.csv: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
predictor/static/rf_model.pkl: The trained Random Forest model.
predictor/static/scaler.pkl: The scaler used for feature normalization.
predictor/static/dataset_stats.pkl: Precomputed dataset statistics for the dashboard.

Run Migrations:Apply Django migrations to set up the database:
python manage.py migrate

Collect Static Files:If static files (e.g., images generated by the dashboard) are not loading, run:
python manage.py collectstatic

Start the Server:Launch the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver

Access the App:Open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Usage
Register/Login:

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/ to create an account.
Log in at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/.

Make a Prediction:
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/ (requires login).
Enter apple characteristics (e.g., Size, Weight, Sweetness) and submit to get a quality prediction ("Good" or "Bad").
Use the "Back to Home" button to return to the home page and make another prediction.

View Dashboard:
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/ (requires login).
View model performance metrics, including accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a pie chart of quality distribution.

Retrain the Model (Optional)
If you don’t have the rf_model.pkl or scaler.pkl files, you can retrain the model:

Prepare the Dataset:
Ensure apple_quality.csv is in predictor/static/.
The dataset should have columns: A_id, Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, Acidity, Quality.

Run the Training Script:Create a Python script (e.g., train_model.py) with the following code:
import pandas as pd
import pickle
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('predictor/static/apple_quality.csv')
data = data.drop('A_id', axis=1)
data['Quality'] = data['Quality'].map({'good': 1, 'bad': 0})
data = data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').dropna()
data['Size_Sweetness'] = data['Size'] * data['Sweetness']
data['Weight_Size'] = data['Weight'] / (data['Size'] + 1e-6)

# Prepare features and target
X = data[['Size', 'Weight', 'Sweetness', 'Crunchiness', 'Juiciness', 'Ripeness', 'Acidity', 'Size_Sweetness', 'Weight_Size']]
y = data['Quality']

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Save model and scaler
with open('predictor/static/rf_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
with open('predictor/static/scaler.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(scaler, f)

Run the script:
python train_model.py


Generate Dataset Stats:Update the script to generate dataset_stats.pkl and visualizations as needed (refer to views.py for logic).
